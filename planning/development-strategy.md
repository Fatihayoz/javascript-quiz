<!--

  you will write dev strategies in this starter basically the same as in Incremental Developments
  the only difference is that there are now more types of tasks, for example:
    `type: css`
    `type: html`
    `type: logic`
    `type: handlers`
    `type: components`
    `type: listeners`
    `type: init`
    ...

  a single user story may require a little bit of code in each of these folders
  it will take some time and practice to get used to this

-->

<!--

  you will need 3 wireframes:
  - home page (just things to read, no interactions)
  - quiz page (where a user takes the quiz)
  - questions page (where a user can modify the quiz questions)
